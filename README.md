Markov Chain Monto Carlo Annealing 

Simple yet powerful, in the age of GenAI and big data we wanted to show that simple ideas and solutions can win.
Markov Chain Annealing in its simplest form is guess and check if its correct accept the change and if its not better do not except the change. Except some of time (typically refered to as the "temperature") you accept changes that are worse in the hope it get you closer to the solution
